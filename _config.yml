description: "The island of Ireland is strewn with caves. From the 97m rope descent into Noon's Hole in Fermanagh to the 16km of passage in Pollnagollum, Co. Clare, the island is packed with beautiful and exciting underground passages.

The rich underground never fails to provoke awe in those who dare to visit it - if you will let us, we intend to illuminate the wonders beneath your doorstep!"
