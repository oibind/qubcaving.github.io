			<p>The island of Ireland is strewn with caves. From the <strong>97m</strong> rope descent into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon%27s_Hole" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Noon's Hole</em></a> in Fermanagh to the <strong>16km</strong> of passage in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollnagollum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Pollnagollum</em></a>, Co. Clare, the island is packed with beautiful and exciting underground passages.</p>

			<p>The rich underground never fails to provoke awe in those who dare to visit it - if you will let us, we intend to illuminate the wonders beneath your doorstep!</p>

			<h1>SRT Training</h1>
			<p>Each <strong>Wednesday evening, 5pm-8pm</strong>, the club meets at the PEC Climbing wall to learn the technical skills prerequisite to vertical caving. Our beginner-friendly <abbr title="Single Rope Technique">SRT</abbr> training sessions serve as the bedrock of our club community, and are often followed by impromptu club socials.</p>

			<h1>Caving Trips</h1>
			<p>The caves of Fermanagh and Cavan are our main stomping ground, offering diverse experiences for beginners and seasoned potholers alike. However, we have been known to organize trips further afield: traveling to the North coast, Co. Clare, Co. Tipperary, Yorkshire, and beyond.</p>

			<p>We offer both single-day and overnight trips to our members, typically aiming for the first weekend of each month. Upcoming trips will be advertised to club members via both email and WhatsApp.</p>
